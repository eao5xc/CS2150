	I found out that this lab is easier than the previous one, and the difficulties I had on this lab are \
the input process, conversion from string to integer, and concept of string in c_str, character, and integer. I, then, went to meet TA during office hours, and TA helped me clarify all of my difficulties. (They are really helpful!). I knew that I have to convert the string to array of character in order to check that the character is digit. Then, I checked the length of string in the case that it is a negative number since numbers and operations are separated by space. I also realized that the atoi() method is really useful since it can convert char to integer (even it is negative).\
